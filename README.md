Analysis of the data set and the observations: 

We consider “Status “ as the primary key in our analysis. Based on the Employee being in the Terminated or Active status we will do our analysis. 
From the data, we could see that: 
• The Employees who are in Terminated status have Termination type as either “Voluntary or involuntary” 
➢ Voluntary Terminations reasons are “Resignation or Retirement” 
➢ Involuntary Termination reason is only one which is “Layoff” 
• All the Female Employees who are in terminated status with Termination reason as “Retirement” belongs to the age of 65years. 
i.e; female voluntary Retirement age is 65 years. 
• All the Male Employees who are in terminated status with Termination reason as “Retirement” belongs to the age of 60years. 
i.e; male voluntary Retirement age is 60 years. 
• It is also clear from the dataset that the Resignation and Retirement is NOT DEPENDENT on the length of service. 
Eg: we could see an employee with 22 years of service and of 63years (F)resigned whereas an employee with 8years of service and 60years retired(M)3
